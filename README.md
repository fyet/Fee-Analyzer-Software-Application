Overview/Description: This program captures the difference between customary market base/expected appraisal fees for appraisal products and 
  the fees actually charged for services rendered, in addition to the specific reasons for the increased amounts. This script is designed to compare
  customary base fees for each market nationwide (over 50 products per market), in addition to intaking and storing data related to thousands of orders 
  each month into custom built data structures. Algorithms leverage text mining order data to identify cost-increasing factors, compute correlating 
  add-on fees, and compare fee thresholds of what was charged to what was expected. The algorithm provids output data used for internal decision 
  making and client reporting. This program was originally built in C and C++, then later refactored to Python.

Operating System Dependencies: Built and tested on Windows 10 / MS-DOS.

Python Module Dependencies: See comments in files for more information.
